In this project, I learned a significant amount while conducting a Video Game Sales Analysis. Here are some of the key insights and skills I developed throughout the process:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

I enhanced my data handling skills by using Pandas and NumPy to clean and prepare the dataset. This involved:

Removing unnecessary columns to streamline the data.
Handling missing values using SimpleImputer from Scikit-learn, applying mean imputation for numerical data, and ensuring date columns were correctly formatted.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I conducted a thorough EDA to uncover trends and insights, such as:

Identifying the top-selling titles worldwide, with Grand Theft Auto V and Call of Duty franchises leading the charts.
Analyzing yearly sales data, revealing that 2008 was a peak year for the industry, followed by a decline around 2010.

Visualization Skills

Using Plotly Express, I created interactive visualizations that effectively communicated my findings, including:

Bar charts displaying the top 10 titles by worldwide sales and the top years for sales.
A sunburst chart illustrating console specialization in genres, highlighting that the PC excels in Adventure and Strategy genres.

Market Insights

I discovered interesting regional sales patterns, such as:

Titles that performed well in North America but flopped in other regions, like Madden NFL 2004.
Conversely, games popular in Japan, such as Hot Shots Golf, did not resonate in other markets.

This project not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of market dynamics in the gaming industry. I'm excited to leverage these insights in future analyses!
